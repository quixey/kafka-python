I (Jim Lim) am releasing this to pypi under quixey for personal convenience.

This module provides low-level protocol support for Apache Kafka as well as
high-level consumer and producer classes. Request batching is supported by the
protocol as well as broker-aware request routing. Gzip and Snappy compression
is also supported for message sets.
